Davis and his peerless band &#x2013; bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, pianist Bill Evans, and the titanic sax team of John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley &#x2013; soloed in uncluttered settings, typified by &quot;melodic rather than harmonic variation,&quot; as Davis put it. Two numbers, &quot;All Blues&quot; and &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; (the latter featured Wynton Kelly at the ivories in place of Evans), were in 12-bar form, but Davis&apos; approach allowed his players a cool, new, collected freedom.

No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation &#x2013; a nation of teens suddenly turned punk &#x2013; and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator.

Lyrically, Cobain raged in code &#x2013; shorthand grenades of inner tumult and self-loathing. His genius, though, in songs like &quot;Lithium,&quot; &quot;Breed&quot; and &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; was the soft-loud tension he created between verse and chorus, restraint and assault. Cobain was a pop lover at heart &#x2013; and a Beatlemaniac: Nevermind producer Butch Vig remembers hearing Cobain play John Lennon&apos;s &quot;Julia&quot; at sessions.

But in December, Dylan played the record for his brother David in Minneapolis, who suggested recutting some songs with local musicians. The final Blood was a mix of the slow, pensive New York sessions and the faster, wilder Minneapolis dates.

{"sequence":1,"album":"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band","year":"1967","image":"maxresdefault-44c6ea70-41a8-48cc-9198-9c81ffa11311.jpg","id":351029,"information":"<p><em>Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> is the most important rock &amp; roll album ever made, an unsurpassed adventure in concept, sound, songwriting, cover art and studio technology by the greatest rock &amp; roll group of all time. From the title song&apos;s regal blasts of brass and fuzz guitar to the orchestral seizure and long, dying piano chord at the end of &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; the 13 tracks on <em>Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> are the pinnacle of the Beatles&apos; eight years as recording artists. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were never more fearless and unified in their pursuit of magic and transcendence.</p><p>Issued in Britain on June 1st, 1967, and a day later in America, <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> is also rock&apos;s ultimate declaration of change. For the Beatles, it was a decisive goodbye to matching suits, world tours and assembly-line record-making. &quot;We were fed up with being Beatles,&quot; McCartney said decades later, in <em>Many Years From Now</em>, Barry Miles&apos; McCartney biography. &quot;We were not boys, we were men... artists rather than performers.</p><p>At the same time, <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> formally ushered in an unforgettable season of hope, upheaval and achievement: the late 1960s and, in particular, 1967&apos;s Summer of Love. In its iridescent instrumentation, lyric fantasias and eye-popping packaging, <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> defined the opulent revolutionary optimism of psychedelia and instantly spread the gospel of love, acid, Eastern spirituality and electric guitars around the globe. No other pop record of that era, or since, has had such an immediate, titanic impact. This music documents the world&apos;s biggest rock band at the very height of its influence and ambition.</p><p>&quot;It was a peak,&quot; Lennon told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in 1970, describing both the album and his collaborative relationship with McCartney. &quot;Paul and I were definitely working together,&quot; Lennon said, and Sgt. Pepper is rich with proof: McCartney&apos;s burst of hot piano and school-days memoir (&quot;Woke up, fell out of bed...&quot;) in Lennon&apos;s &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; a reverie on mortality and infinity; Lennon&apos;s impish rejoinder to McCartney&apos;s chorus in &quot;Getting Better&quot; (&quot;It can&apos;t get no worse&quot;).</p><p>&quot;<em>Sgt. Pepper</em> was our grandest endeavor,&quot; Starr said, looking back, in the band&apos;s 2000 autobiography, <em>The Beatles Anthology. </em>&quot;The greatest thing about the band was that whoever had the best idea &#x2013; it didn&apos;t matter who &#x2013; that was the one we&apos;d use.&quot; It was Neil Aspinall, the Beatles&apos; longtime assistant, who suggested they reprise the title track, just before the finale of &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; to complete <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>&apos;s theatrical conceit: an imaginary concert by a fictional band, played by the Beatles.</p><p>The first notes went to tape on December 6th, 1966: two takes of McCartney&apos;s music-hall confection &quot;When I&apos;m Sixty-Four.&quot; (Lennon&apos;s lysergic reflection on his Liverpool childhood, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; was started two weeks earlier but issued in February 1967 as a stand-alone single.) But <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>&apos;s real birthday is August 29th, 1966, when the Beatles played their last live concert, in San Francisco. Until then, they had made history in the studio between punishing tours. Off the road for good, the Beatles were free to be a band away from the hysteria of Beatlemania.</p><p>McCartney went a step further. On a plane to London in November &apos;66, as he returned from a vacation in Kenya, he came up with the idea of an album by the Beatles in disguise, an alter-ego group that he subsequently dubbed Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band. &quot;We&apos;d pretend to be someone else,&quot; McCartney explained in <em>Anthology</em>. &quot;It liberated you &#x2013; you could do anything when you got to the mic or on your guitar, because it wasn&apos;t you.&quot;</p><p>Only two songs on the final LP, both McCartney&apos;s, had anything to do with the Pepper characters: the title track and Starr&apos;s jaunty vocal showcase, &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends,&quot; introduced as a number by <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>&apos;s star crooner, Billy Shears. &quot;Every other song could have been on any other album,&quot; Lennon insisted later. Yet it is hard to imagine a more perfect setting for the Victorian jollity of Lennon&apos;s &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; (inspired by an 1843 circus poster) or the sumptuous melancholy of McCartney&apos;s &quot;Fixing a Hole,&quot; with its blend of antique shadows (a harpsichord played by the Beatles&apos; producer, George Martin) and modern sunshine (double-tracked lead guitar executed with ringing precision by Harrison). The <em>Pepper</em> premise was a license to thrill.</p><p>It also underscored the real-life cohesion of the music and the group that made it. Of the 700 hours the Beatles spent making <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> from the end of 1966 until April 1967, the group needed only three days&apos; worth to complete Lennon&apos;s lavish daydream &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds.&quot; &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; the most complex song on the album, was done in just five days. (The oceanic piano chord was three pianos hit simultaneously by 10 hands belonging to Lennon, McCartney, Starr, Martin and Beatles roadie Mal Evans.) No other Beatles appear with Harrison on his sitar-perfumed sermon on materialism and fidelity, &quot;Within You Without You,&quot; but the band wisely placed the track at the halfway point of the original vinyl LP, at the beginning of Side Two: a vital meditation break in the middle of the jubilant indulgence.</p><p>The Beatles&apos; exploitation of multitracking transformed the very act of studio recording (the orchestral overdubs on &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; marked the debut of eight-track recording in Britain: two four-track machines used in sync). And <em>Sgt. Pepper</em>&apos;s visual extravagance officially elevated the album cover to a work of art. Michael Cooper&apos;s photo of the Beat&#xAD;les in satin marching-band outfits, in front of a cardboard-cutout audience of historical figures, created by artist Peter Blake, is the most enduring image of the psychedelic era. <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> was also the first rock album to incorporate complete lyrics to the songs in its design.</p><p>Yet <em>Sgt. Pepper</em> is the Number One album of the RS 500 not just because of its firsts &#x2013; it is simply the best of everything the Beatles ever did as musicians, pioneers and pop stars, all in one place. A 1967 British print ad for the album declared, &quot;Remember, Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band Is the Beatles.&quot; As McCartney put it, the album was &quot;just us doing a good show.&quot;</p><p>The show goes on forever.</p><p><strong>Voters:&#xA0;</strong>Bill Adler (Biographer, Run-DMC), Lou Adler (Producer), Vince Aletti (Writer), Art Alexakis (Everclear), Pelle Almqvist (The Hives), Billy Altman (Writer), Jeff Ament (Pearl Jam), Roger Ames (Former chairman and CEO,&#xA0;Warner Music Group), Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day), Nicholaus Arson (The Hives), Dick Asher (Former CEO, Polygram Records), James Austin (Former A&amp;R, Rhino Records), Michael Azerrad (Writer), Irving Azoff (Executive chairman, Live Nation), Martin Bandier (Chairman and CEO,&#xA0;Sony/ATV), Devendra Banhart, Peter Barakan (Radio host), Johnny Barbis (Chairman, Rocket Music), Ken Barnes (Writer), Kevin Barnes&#xA0;(Of Montreal), Frank Barsalona (Former consultant, William Morris Agency), Rostam Batmanglij (Vampire Weekend), David Bauder (Writer), Beck, Jules Belkin (Former president, Belkin Productions),Andy Bell (Erasure), Bill Belmont (Former VP, international operations, Fantasy Records), Bill Bentley (Director, A&amp;R, Vanguard Records), Steve Berkowitz (Senior VP, A&amp;R,&#xA0; Legacy Recordings), James Bernard (Co-founder, <em>The Source</em>&#xA0;and <em>XXL</em> magazines), Cathy Bernardy Jones (Former editor, <em>Goldmine</em> magazine), Guy Berryman (Coldplay), Jim Bessman (Writer), Les Bider (Former chairman and CEO, Warner/Chappell Music), Scott Billington (VP, A&amp;R, Rounder Records), Mark Binelli (Contributing editor,&#xA0;<em>Rolling Stone),&#xA0;</em>Rodney Bingenheimer (Radio personality), David Bither (Senior VP, Nonesuch Records), Hal Blaine (Drummer), Jerry Blavat (Radio and TV personality), Mary J.

The Beatles made a point of echoing them on <em>Sgt. Pepper&apos;s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em> &#x2013; an acknowledgment that <em>Pet Sounds</em> was the inspiration for the Beatles&apos; masterpiece. That gesture actually completed a circle of influence: Wilson initially conceived of <em>Pet Sounds</em> as an effort to top the Beatles&apos; <em>Rubber Soul</em>.</p><p>With its vivid orchestration, lyrical ambition, elegant pacing and thematic coherence, <em>Pet Sounds</em> invented &#x2013; and in some sense perfected &#x2013; the idea that an album could be more than the sum of its parts. When Wilson sang, &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if we were older?&quot; on the magnificent opener, he wasn&apos;t just imagining a love that could evolve past high school; he was suggesting a new grown-up identity for rock &amp; roll music itself.</p><p>Wilson essentially made <em>Pet Sounds</em> without the rest of the band, using them only to flesh out the vocal arrangements. (He even considered putting the album out as a solo project, and the first single, &quot;Caroline, No,&quot; was released under his own name.) Its luxurious sound conveys a heartbreaking wistfulness, and the deeply personal songs, which Wilson co-wrote primarily with lyricist Tony Asher, bid farewell to the innocent world of the Beach Boys&apos; fun-in-the-sun hits. Unfortunately, Capitol Records proved no more enamored of <em>Pet Sounds</em> than had Love; the label considered not releasing it at all. Not yet vindicated by history, Wilson withdrew further into his inner world. &quot;At the last meeting I attended concerning <em>Pet Sounds</em>,&quot; Wilson wrote about his dealings with the label, &quot;I showed up holding a tape player and eight prerecorded, looped responses, including &apos;No comment,&apos; &apos;Can you repeat that?&apos; &apos;No&apos; and &apos;Yes.&apos; Refusing to utter a word, I played the various tapes when appropriate.&quot;</p>","order":500,"label":"Capitol","artist":"The Beach Boys"}
